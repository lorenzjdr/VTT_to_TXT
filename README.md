# WHY ?
VTT contains timestamps that I don't need. I built this so I can save some time for a class. 

# WIP - GUI for the user to just simply upload the VTT file

# Description
CLI progam that extracts user dialogue from a given vtt file.  

# How to Use
```Clone the repository```  

```Run main.py```  

``` Enter the VTT file name in terminal ```

It should output the .txt file !
